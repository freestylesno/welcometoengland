			<h1>Staying in London -- Overview</h1>
			<br>
			<p style = "margin-bottom: 25px;">There are so many choices of places to stay in London!!</p>
			<p style = "margin-bottom: 25px;">So what are the differences between Hotels, Hostels, and B&B's</p>
			<p style = "margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Hotels</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good news -- you will find most of the m,ajor U.S. hotel chains in London. Bad news -- it can be verry expensive to stay in London, especially in the central area. But if your Budget can handleit, they have most of the usual amenitieds that the U.S. has. Some even offer "free breakfast and free WiFi".</p>

			 <p style = "margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Hostels</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dont let those scary movies freak you out! I always stay in Hostels and have never had a problem. Let's face it-- you're going to be out all day and only back to the "hotel" to shower and sleep.  Why pay $200+ a night for that, when you can pay $30 a night instead. Yes, you have to share a room but you get your own bed and suitcase-size licker in the rooms for you to lock up your valuables. I usually travel by myself so this works for me. If you'er traveling wioth more people, you can share the cost. In hotels, you almost never talk to other guests. In hostels, you can speak with people from all over the world. It's an amazing experience.</p>
			 <p style = "margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>bed & breakfast</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the B&B's om Cenrtral london look and act more like hotels, though are usually owned by a single owner vs. a corporation. Their price range is usually mid-way between hotels and hostels.  If you want something more B&B like, you will have to stay outside of town.</p>
